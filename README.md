Offline-Teleporter
==================
A bukkit plugin that let's you tp to offline players and vice versa


This Plugin is in **Pre-alpha** for the moment! :P (i just wanted to make my very first repository really :)
Everything in the Pre-Alpha stage will have version 0.0!


Since this is my first plugin, i'll be //documenting every step so that people like me(newbies) can learn
from it and so that Advanced Programmers can easily help out (If they want to!) :)

To-Do List
--------------
- ~~Tp to an offline Player~~ :white_check_mark:
- Tp an offline player to your position (when he logs in)
- Auto tab complete for offline player names (really no idea as to how atm :s)
- Your Ideas!? :)

Awesome people!
