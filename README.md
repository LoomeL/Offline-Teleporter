Offline Teleporter
==================
A bukkit plugin that let's you tp to offline players and vice versa


This Plugin is in **Beta** for the moment!
Everything in the Beta stage will have the version format: 0.# ! :)


Since this is my first plugin, i'll be //documenting every step so that people (like me(newbies)) can learn
from it and so that Advanced Programmers can easily help out (If they want to!) :)

To-Do List
--------------
- ~~Tp to an offline Player~~ :white_check_mark:
- ~~Tp an offline player to your position (when he logs in)~~:white_check_mark:
- Auto tab complete for offline player names (really no idea as to how atm :s)
- **Your Ideas!? :smiley:**
